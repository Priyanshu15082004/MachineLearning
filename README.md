Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn patterns from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed. ML models improve their accuracy over time through experience.

Types of Machine Learning:

Supervised Learning - The model learns from labeled data (e.g., classification, regression).

Unsupervised Learning - The model identifies patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering, anomaly detection).

Reinforcement Learning - The model learns through rewards and penalties (e.g., robotics, game AI).
