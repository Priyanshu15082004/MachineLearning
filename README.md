Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn patterns from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed. ML models improve their accuracy over time through experience.

Types of Machine Learning:

Supervised Learning - The model learns from labeled data (e.g., classification, regression).

Unsupervised Learning - The model identifies patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering, anomaly detection).

Reinforcement Learning - The model learns through rewards and penalties (e.g., robotics, game AI).

Python

Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation

Scikit-Learn for ML models

Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

Jupyter Notebook for experimentation

<H1>Logistic Regression</H1>
<p>Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for binary classification (e.g., Yes/No, 0/1, Spam/Not Spam). It predicts the probability that a given input belongs to a particular category using the logistic (sigmoid) function.</p>

<h>Types of Logistic Regression</h>
Binary Logistic Regression: Classifies into two categories (e.g., pass/fail, default/not default).

Multinomial Logistic Regression: Classifies into more than two categories (e.g., predicting weather as sunny, cloudy, or rainy).

Ordinal Logistic Regression: Used when the categories have a meaningful order (e.g., low, medium, high).</p>
